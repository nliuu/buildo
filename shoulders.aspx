            <p style="color:gold">Stand with a dumbbell in each hand, arms by your sides, palms facing inwards.<br />Ensure your shoulders are relaxed (not raised), your abs are engaged (think tensing, as opposed to breathing in), and there’s a slight bend in your knees.<br />Retaining this posture, lift the dumbbells out to the sides with straight arms, going no higher than shoulder height.<br />Pause and check your stance – is your back still neutral and your tailbone tucked under? Is there a gentle bend at each elbow? 'It’s important to keep your shoulders away from your ears and legs still to ensure proper form,' Bowman adds.<br />Gradually (i.e. don't just let your arms fall back down, move with control) lower the dumbbells to the starting position. Repeat for 3 sets of 8-12 reps. </p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
