             <p style="color:gold"> Step 1: Lie on a flat bench with a dumbbell in each hand.<br/>Step 2: Clean the dumbbells to your shoulders and raise them straight overhead so that the dumbbells are parallel with the floor and your palms are facing forward. One side of each dumbbell should touch each other. This is your starting position.<br/>Step 3: Inhale as you lower the dumbbells straight down to your chest, with the plate of each dumbbell right above your chest. Your upper arms should not move and your elbows should end up pointing straight outward with your palms facing forward and your thumbs on bottom.<br/>Step 4: Exhale as you slowly reverse the motion back to the starting position.<br/>Step 5: Repeat for a complete set.</p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

            </p>
            <p style="color:gold">Flex your elbows and lower the weight down toward the top of your head. Your upper arms should remain relatively perpendicular to your body. This keeps the tension on the triceps versus shifting it to the shoulders.<br/>Continue lowering the weight behind the head. The bottom of the dumbbell head should be about in line with the bench's top, or even a little higher if this feels unwieldy.<br/>Reverse the movement until the weight is above the chest in the original starting position. Keep from locking the elbow to maintain tension in your triceps muscle.<br/>Repeat.&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
