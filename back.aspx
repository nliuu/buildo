             <p style="color:gold">The upright row is a weight training exercise performed by holding a weight with an overhand grip and lifting it straight up to the collarbone. This is a compound exercise that involves the trapezius, the deltoids and the biceps. The narrower the grip the more the trapezius muscles are exercised, as opposed to the deltoids.<br />Barbells, dumbbells, kettlebells or a cable machine can be used. </p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
